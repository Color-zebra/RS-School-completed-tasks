				<section>An architecture is a set of rules and conventions for organizing code. The main goal is to make the project understandable and structured, especially in the context of regular changes and additions.</section>

						<ul>
							<li>Exclusively for the frontend.</li>
							<li>May be overkill for small projects.</li>
							<li>May not be suitable for VERY large applications.</li>
							<li>Suitable for any framework or language.</li>

						A public API is a public interface that provides a single point of access to all the capabilities of a module and determines how this module will interact with the outside world.
						<ul>
							<li>Protects the internal structure of modules from uncontrolled change.</li>
							<li>Helps to encapsulate modules.</li>
							<li>Allows you to easily define module behaviors based on API methods.</li>

						Segments are the third and final level of the organizational hierarchy. Their task is to group the code according to its technical nature.
